This is a simple project, which provides an example of using 3-dimensional arrays in OpenCL.
As it is, it simply returns the values of the indices in the output arrays.
Uncommenting one line in the kernel will allow the user to process the input arrays on
the OpenCL device, and bring back the result.

This example is intended as a starting point for building more complex projects, for example 
3-dimensional lattice simulations.
